Adaptation of a demo video I watched on using the ml5 library. This project has 4 functionalities:\

`sketch.js` Label uploaded image with confidence score\
`webcam.js` Label webcam stream with confidence score\
`detection.js` Detect all objects in an image, assigning them bounding boxes and confidence scores\
`detect_from_webcam.js` Detect all objects from webcam stream, giving bounding boxes and confidence scores\
